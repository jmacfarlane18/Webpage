        	<h1>Biography</h1>
        	<p><b>Mária Telkes</b> is an Hungarian-born American physical chemist and biophysicist best known for her invention of the
        	 solar distiller and the first solar-powered heating system designed for residences. She also invented other devices capable
        	 of storing energy captured from sunlight.</p></br>
        	<p>She studied physical chemistry at the <a href="https://www.elte.hu/en/">University of Budapest</a>, graduating with a B.A. in 1920 and a Ph.D. in 1924. She 
        	became an instructor at the institution in 1924 but decided to immigrate to the United States after visiting a relative, who
        	served at the time as the Hungarian consul in Cleveland. In 1925 she accepted a position as a biophysicist for the Cleveland
        	Clinic Foundation, where she worked with American surgeon George Washington Crile to create a photoelectric device that 
        	recorded brain waves.</p></br>
        	<p>Telkes became an American citizen in 1937. That same year she became a research engineer at Westinghouse Electric, where 
        	she developed instruments that converted heat into electrical energy; however, she made her first forays into solar energy 
        	research in 1939. That year, as part of the Solar Energy Conversion Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
        	she worked on thermoelectric devices powered by sunlight. Telkes was assigned to the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and 
        	Development during World War II, and it was there that she created one of her most important inventions: a solar distiller 
        	capable of vaporizing seawater and recondensing it into drinkable water. Although the system was carried aboard life rafts 
        	during the war, it was also scaled up to supplement the water demands of the Virgin Islands.</p></br>
        	<p>Until the end of her career, Telkes continued to develop solar-energy applications and received several patents for her 
        	work. Together with American architect Eleanor Raymond, she designed and constructed the world’s first modern residence heated 
        	with solar energy.She improved upon existing heat-exchanger technology to create solar stoves and solar heaters, receiving a 
        	$45,000 grant from the Ford Foundation in 1953 to create a universal <a href="http://solarcooking.wikia.com/wiki/M%C3%A1ria_Telkes">solar oven</a> that could be adapted for use by people living 
        	at all latitudes. She also worked to develop materials capable of enduring the temperature extremes of space. In 1980 she 
        	assisted the U.S. Department of Energy in the development of the world’s first solar-electric residence, which was built in 
        	Carlisle, Massachusetts.
