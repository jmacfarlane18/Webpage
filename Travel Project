		<h2><center>Travel to Coba, Mexico</center></h2><!--centered secondary heading-->
		
		<h3>Why You Should Visit Coba</h3>
		<p>Coba means ‘waters stirred by the wind’, an appropriate Mayan name as this settlement is surrounded by two large lagoons.
		For many years Coba was an ignored piece of Mayan history due to its location. Located between Tulum in the state of Quintana Roo, and Valladolid 
		in the state of Yucatan, archeologists first learned about the site in the mid 1800’s, but dense jungle, the Caste War and lack of funds made this
		site a difficult area to penetrate. This Mayan site is still largely unexcavated making it a true wonder in the Yucatan. Visitors can enjoy shaded
		walkways that are the original sacbe (white roads), three settlements that show the architecture and vast area of this once large city, 2 ball 
		courts and climb the highest Mayan pyramid in the Yucatan, Nohoch Mul.</p><!--paragraph with history-->

		<h3>Reviews from past travelers</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><q>Great day visiting the Coba ruins....zip lining, riding bikes, climbing to the top of a ruin, and swimming in the cenotes was all
				a part of this fabulous day!</q>-Ali G. (Breton, Canada)
				<li><q>The ruins at Coba are impressive and very interesting. They are not excavated or cleared out as Chichen Itza and that makes the
				experience different and exciting.</q>-Diane R. (Reno, Nevada)
				<li><q>We loved visiting Coba especially the jungle walk and climb to the top of Nohuch-Mul. The view from the top is amazing and helps
				you really imagine what it must have been like back at the height of Mayan civilization.</q>-Carrie N. (Whittier, California)
