					<li>Everyone from young children to grandparents can get in on the fun. Bowling can easily be adapted with the use of bumpers to be made more accessible.
					<li>While bowling is a sport that can help get kids active, it is generally easier on the body than most contact sports <img src="glowbowl.jpg"alt="A picture of a man bowling in a dark alley with glow in the dark lights" height="150" width="200"/>
					<li>Bowling is relatively inexpensive and bowling alleys are virtually everywhere, so it is easy to get started. In addition, all the materials are provided for you.
					<li>A little friendly competition is a great way to bond with friends, family, or coworkers <img src="bowlfriends.jpg"alt="A woman and man smiling as they prepare to bowl" height="150" width="200"/>
					<li>Although bowling can be competitive, the environment is usually laid back and you can eat food while you play!
